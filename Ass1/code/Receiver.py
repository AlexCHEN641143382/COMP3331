# Simple Transport Protocol (STP)
#
# Receiving side program
# 
# Three major components to data transmission and re-transmission:
# 1. Data received from app layer above
# 2. Timer timeout
# 3. ACK receipt

# 1. Sender waits for data to be passed down from app layer
# 		wait()
# 2. stp_send(data) is called by app layer.
# 3. sender creates packet sndpkt + checksum
# 		stp_send(data)
# 4. send packet via. udp_send
# 		udp_send()

# On packet arrival, receiver replies with ACK/NAK depending on if packet is corrupted
Corrupted = stp_rcv(rcvpkt) && corrupt()
#     -> send NAK packet via. udp_send()
Uncorrupted = rdt_rcv(rcvpkt) && notCorrupt()
#     -> cont. to next step

# Extract data
extract()

# Deliver data to upper layer
deliver()

# Send ACK packet back
udt_send()



# wait for ACK packet -> ACK comes back
# if waiting, can't receive more data from app layer = stp_send() can't occur
# if ACK, go back to waiting for data from app layer
stp_rcv(rcvpkt) && isACK


# wait for ACK packet -> NAK comes back
# if waiting, can't receive more data from app layer = stp_send() can't occur
# if NAK, retransmit last packet + wait for ACK again
stp_rcv(rcvpkt) && isNAK

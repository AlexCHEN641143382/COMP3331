Q1.)
HTTP request with an “if-modified” header.

If object in a server has not changed since last retrieval by the client, then server will send a “304 Not Modified” response.

304 Not Modified response is for caching purposes.
Tells client that the response has not been modified, so the client can use the cached version of the response.

Q2.)
Local DNS name servers.

DNS = Domain Name System: The hierarchy of Name Servers that translates host names into IP addresses on a global scale.
Name Server = Hosts or caches these translations.

DNS Queries can be resolved in a number of ways:
1. A client can answer a query locally by using cached information obtained from a prev query.
2. A DNS server can use its own cache of resource records to answer a query.
3. A DNS server can query other DNS servers on behalf of the requesting client to resolve the name, then send an answer back to the client (RECURSION)
4. The client itself can attempt to contact additional DNS servers to resolve a name. This is done by using separate and additional queries based on referral answers from servers. (ITERATION)

Q3.)

Q4.)
u_s = 10Mbps
u_i = 1Mbps
d_i = 10Mbps

n = 100 people
F = 100,000,000 bits

Min distribution time = MAX { F/u_s , F/d_i , N*F / (u_s + sum(u_i)) }
= MAX { 100,000,000 / 10,000,000 | 100,000,000 / 10,000,000 | (100 * 100,000,000) / (10,000,000 + (1,000,000 * 100) ) }
= MAX { 10 | 10 | (10,000,000,000 / (10,000,000 + 100,000,000) ) }
= MAX { 10 | 10 | 10,000,000,000 / 110,000,000 }
= MAX { 10 | 10 | 90.9 }
Therefore, min distribution time = 90.9 seconds = ~100 seconds

Q5.) BitTorrent

Q6.)
10 connections traverse link at 10Gbps
Client access link = 5Mbps
Maximum throughput for each connection = 100Mbps (T or F?)

ANS:
10,000mbps link / 10 connections = 1,000mbps per connection
1,000Mbps / 5Mbps = 200Mbps
Therefore the suggested answer is FALSE.

Q7.)
Transmission rate = R
Packet arrives to queue every 1/a seconds
Packet length = L

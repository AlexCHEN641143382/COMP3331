39Mb MP3 file from src -> dest

All links have transmission rate = 10Mbps
Propagation = 2 * 10^8 meters / sec = 2,000,000,000m per sec = 2,000,000km per sec
Distance between src â€”> dest = 10,000km

Q1.)
Transmission = L (size of packet) / R (transmission rate) = 39,000bits / 10,000bps = 3.9 bits per sec
Propagation = d (physical distance) / s (propagation speed) = 10,000km / 2,000,000kmps = 0.005secs = 5ms

Therefore
